To use you need the following libraries:

- libxml (tree, parser, xmlstring)
- nlohmann/json (used for json parsing)
- openssl (sha1 hashing)

Additionally, make sure all xml files ran through srcml are of the format: "originalCodeFile.cpp.xml"
For example, the file "MazeGame.cpp" should have the corresponding xml file "MazeGame.cpp.xml"

Running the program
- make clean
- make attributor
- ./attributor [json file]

It should hopefully work. Hail Mary.

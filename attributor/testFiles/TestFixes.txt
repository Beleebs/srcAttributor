AS OF 9/12/2025

Test 1: (basic program)
    - It works. HOORAY!!!!!!!

Test 2: (if statements)
    - slice:use for b is missing line 9
    - declaration for one of the parameters in line 15 is missing
    - (its pass by value, the function return is correct)

Test 3: (for loops)
    - Need to fix the insertion of for loops
        - slice:use of y is included in the <init> portion.
        - i only used once in <init>, not in other <expr>'s

Test 4: (while loop)
    - slice:def for x missing in line 9
        - probably due to it being part of block content, a child of the while element in line 8.

Test 5: (value vs. reference)
    - ill have to ask about the syntax of using pass by reference

GENERAL CHANGES: (FIX FIRST)
    - rework concatenation criteria, some of them are not working properly.
    - maybe place slice hashes into function parameter lists
